			<h2> 
				Description of Company
			</h2> 
			
			<p style = "font-size:12;"> 
				This is a two paragraph description of a streaming service company. It probably talks about a lot of things, but none of them are particularly important.
				This company was founded in some place unremarkable in california, or some other techy place. It was made because some multimedia giant wasn't making enough money
				using just liscensing deals.
			</p>

			<p style = "font-size:12;">
				This is the second paragraph of the two paragraph description, it probably goes more in detail about something unremarkable. About half way through the pargraph it 
				will kinda just start rambling because it's run out of stuff to talk about, but the author was given some length requirement. I don't actually know what to right here, 
				I've run out of anything useful to say but I think a paragraph should probably be at least 3 or 4 sentances.
